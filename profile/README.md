# IRVC-Genomics

## Overview
Welcome to the Influenza, Respiratory Viruses, and Coronaviruses (IRVC) Genomics Group, a specialized branch under the Health Security and Response Division, dedicated to advancing public health through comprehensive surveillance, research, and diagnostic testing of respiratory pathogens. Our team focuses on influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and emerging respiratory viruses, developing new methods and tools for early detection and epidemic preparedness.

## Mission
To provide innovative and reliable molecular tools and conduct research for the early detection and characterization of respiratory viruses, contributing to global health security.

## Key Activities
Our group undertakes a wide array of activities, including:
- **Surveillance and Monitoring**: Ongoing surveillance for influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and other respiratory pathogens.
- **Proficiency Testing**: Offering panels to assess laboratory capabilities in detecting respiratory viruses.
- **Diagnostic Reference Testing**: Providing PCR-based and sequencing-based tests for pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2, influenza, adenovirus, and more.
- **Drug Susceptibility Testing**: Evaluating antiviral resistance to support treatment protocols.
- **Development of New Detection Methods**: Innovating molecular techniques for enhanced sensitivity and specificity in virus detection.
